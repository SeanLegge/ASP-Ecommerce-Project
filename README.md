This project was created in June 2014 for a school project. 

This project emulated a stop front interface using ASP.Net. It allows users to create a new account and checks to make sure their input is valid. This information is stored into an SQL database. The user is also able to update their own information, find their information or delete their account if they desire. 

The user is also able to add products to the store and set the price which is also checked to make sure it is formatted correctly. They are also abe to update, find and delete products if they deire. They are also able to add products to their cart and emulate a check out process with a list of the products they have chosen and the total.
